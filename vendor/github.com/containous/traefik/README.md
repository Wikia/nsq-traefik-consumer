Træfik (pronounced like [traffic](https://speak-ipa.bearbin.net/speak.cgi?speak=%CB%88tr%C3%A6f%C9%AAk)) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease.
It supports several backends ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), and a lot more) to manage its configuration automatically and dynamically.

## Overview

Imagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices on your infrastructure. You probably used a service registry (like etcd or consul) and/or an orchestrator (swarm, Mesos/Marathon) to manage all these services.
If you want your users to access some of your microservices from the Internet, you will have to use a reverse proxy and configure it using virtual hosts or prefix paths:

- domain `api.domain.com` will point the microservice `api` in your private network
- path `domain.com/web` will point the microservice `web` in your private network
- domain `backoffice.domain.com` will point the microservices `backoffice` in your private network, load-balancing between your multiple instances

But a microservices architecture is dynamic... Services are added, removed, killed or upgraded often, eventually several times a day.

Traditional reverse-proxies are not natively dynamic. You can't change their configuration and hot-reload easily.

Here enters Træfik.

![Architecture](docs/img/architecture.png)

Træfik can listen to your service registry/orchestrator API, and knows each time a microservice is added, removed, killed or upgraded, and can generate its configuration automatically.
Routes to your services will be created instantly.

Run it and forget it!

## Quickstart

You can have a quick look at Træfik in this [Katacoda tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/traefik/deploy-load-balancer) that shows how to load balance requests between multiple Docker containers. If you are looking for a more comprehensive and real use-case example, you can also check [Play-With-Docker](http://training.play-with-docker.com/traefik-load-balancing/) to see how to load balance between multiple nodes.

Here is a talk given by [Emile Vauge](https://github.com/emilevauge) at [GopherCon 2017](https://gophercon.com/).
You will learn Træfik basics in less than 10 minutes.

Here is a talk given by [Ed Robinson](https://github.com/errm) at [ContainerCamp UK](https://container.camp) conference.
You will learn fundamental Træfik features and see some demos with Kubernetes.

## Test it

- The simple way: grab the latest binary from the [releases](https://github.com/containous/traefik/releases) page and just run it with the [sample configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/master/traefik.sample.toml):

```shell
./traefik --configFile=traefik.toml
```

- Use the tiny Docker image and just run it with the [sample configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/master/traefik.sample.toml):

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 80:80 -v $PWD/traefik.toml:/etc/traefik/traefik.toml traefik
```

- From sources:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/containous/traefik
```

## Release cycle

- Release: We try to release a new version every 2 months
  - i.e.: 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0
- Release candidate: we do RC (1.**x**.0-rc**y**) before the final release (1.**x**.0)
  - i.e.: 1.1.0-rc1 -> 1.1.0-rc2 -> 1.1.0-rc3 -> 1.1.0-rc4 -> 1.1.0
- Bug-fixes: For each version we release bug fixes
  - i.e.: 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3
  - those versions contain only bug-fixes
  - no additional features are delivered in those versions
- Each version is supported until the next one is released
  - i.e.: 1.1.x will be supported until 1.2.0 is out
- We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
